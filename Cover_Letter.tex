{\bf Dear Prof. Anna-Karin Tornberg,}

We would like to thank you for your efficient handling of our manuscript. We have done a thorough revision addressing each of the comments/questions brought up by you and the referees. 
In particular, we state clearly at the Introduction that our method has been developed for periodic boundary conditions as it is customary in the IB setting. For bounded domains,  we will lose the 
(near)-translation invariance in $G_h$ which is critical for our expedited approximation. However, this is not as restrictive as it might seem because walls can be implemented in the IB Method 
as immersed boundaries within a periodic domain.

 We have also added a subsection (6.3) to further document numerically the overall accuracy of method and tried  to improve the flow and organization of the paper. 

With best regards, \\

Hector D. Ceniceros and Jordan E. Fisher.
